# Android Firebase Bootstrap

This project allows you to quickly get started building your native Android Application with 
user management from Firebase! It also supports Login w/ Facebook.

The project is an example and contains many DB paths etc. which will not fit for your application. 
If you want to use the project, I encourage you to fork it and modify it to fit your needs.

## Get Started
- Set up your application in Firebase.
- Download and replace google-services.json from Firebase.
- Change the Signing Configs in the application build.gradle to match yours.
- Change the package directory in app/src/main/java/com/username/application/entrance/tools/GetDebugHash.java
